/* * File: Craps.java * ---------------- * This program plays the casino game of Craps.  At the beginning of the game, * the player rolls a pair of dice and computes the total.  If the total is 2, * 3, or 12 (called "craps"), the player loses.  If the total is 7 or 11 * (called a "natural"), the player wins.  If the total is any other number, * that number becomes the "point."  From here, the player keeps rolling the * dice until (a) the point comes up again, in which case the player wins or * (b) a 7 appears, in which case the player loses.  The numbers 2, 3, 11, * and 12 no longer have special significance after the first roll. */import acm.program.*;import acm.util.*;public class Craps extends ConsoleProgram {   public void run() {      int total = rollTwoDice();      if (total == 7 || total == 11) {         println("That's a natural.
