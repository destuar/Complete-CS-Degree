# RULES

- Before responding, generate 2-3 paragraphs of chain-of-thought context reasoning to brainstorm your approach and the best way to format this information in a way that is accessible.

- I am a PhD student, so these notes should be thorough and detailed with a focus on applications for CS and Data Science and should always start with a one or two sentence high-level summary of the concept.
 
 - Please format all notes as Zettelkasten, which is a note-taking system that uses index cards or paper slips to organize information. 
 
 - All notes should be in markdown format with Latex formulas ($ $ for in-line and $$ $$ for new line formulas)

 - You should use "[[]]" to link related concepts in-line, but ONLY if those concepts already exist in the z_Obsidian Notes folder. DO NOT create new links to concepts that do not already exist. If you do not have access to the z_Obsidian Notes folder, ask for it.

 - Example of a good note can be found here: [Linear Dependence.md](mdc:z_Obsidian Notes/Linear Dependence.md), but feel free to adjust as necessary.
