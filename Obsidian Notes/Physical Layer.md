The physical layer is responsible for the actual transmission of raw [[bit]]streams over physical media. It defines the hardware elements involved in the communication process and specifies the characteristics of the physical connections, such as cables, switches, and network interface cards.

### Key Functions:

- **Transmission of Raw Bits:** Converts digital data into electrical, optical, or radio signals for transmission over various media.
- **Physical Media Specification:** Defines the types of cables (e.g., coaxial, fiber optic, twisted pair) and wireless technologies (e.g., Wi-Fi, Bluetooth) used for communication.
- **Signal Encoding:** Determines how bits are represented as signals, including modulation techniques and encoding schemes.
- **Synchronization:** Ensures that the sender and receiver are synchronized for accurate data transmission.

### Examples:

- **Ethernet:** A common wired networking technology used for local area networks (LANs).
- **Wi-Fi:** A wireless networking technology that allows devices to connect to a network without physical cables.
