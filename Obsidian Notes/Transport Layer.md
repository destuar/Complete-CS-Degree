The transport layer is responsible for ensuring reliable data transfer between devices and providing end-to-end communication services. It manages the segmentation, transmission, and reassembly of data, as well as flow control, error detection, and correction.

### Key Protocols:

- **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol):** Provides reliable, connection-oriented communication with error recovery and flow control.
- **UDP (User Datagram Protocol):** Offers a connectionless, lightweight communication method without guaranteed delivery, often used for real-time applications like streaming.

### Functions:

- **Segmentation:** Divides large messages into smaller packets for transmission.
- **Flow Control:** Manages data transmission rates between sender and receiver to prevent congestion.
- **Error Detection:** Ensures data integrity through checksums and acknowledgments.
