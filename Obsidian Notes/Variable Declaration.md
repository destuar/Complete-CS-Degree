**Sets aside memory for storing a value. Variables must be declared before they can be used.**

In many programming languages, including [[Java]], [[variable]] declaration specifies what kind of data the variable can hold (e.g., integer, text, decimal) and gives it a name.

### Syntax of Variable Declaration (Java Example)

In Java, variable declaration generally follows this pattern:

`dataType variableName;`

- **dataType**: Specifies the type of data the variable will hold, such as `int`, `double`, `String`, etc.
- **variableName**: A unique name for the variable, used to reference the data stored in it.

Variables can also be declared and initialized (**=**) within the same statement.
