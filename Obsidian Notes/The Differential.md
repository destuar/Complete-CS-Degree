Definitions:
    The differential $dx = \triangle{x}$
    The differential $df = f'(a)dx = f'(a)\triangle{x}$
    The differential $dy = df$
    The change in $f \triangle{f} = f(a + \triangle{x}) - f(a)$
    The change in $ y \triangle{y} = \triangle{f}

Using the above definitions, we can say the rise of the function $\triangle{f}$ is approximated by the rise of the tangent line, $df$.

This concept is key in differential calculus, where we use the [[tangent line]] to estimate the behavior of functions locally, helping us solve problems involving rates of change, approximations, and errors in measurements.
