A limit of the form $\frac{0}{0}$ or $\frac{\infty}{\infty}$ leads to what is called an "indeterminate form". 

L'HÃ´pital's Rule is a method for finding the limit of a ratio of two functions when it results in an indeterminate form by taking the [[derivative]] of the numerator and denominator before [[computing limits]]. This is useful for simplifying complex limits in calculus and ensuring stable calculations in applied fields. 

In practice, adding an error term, $\epsilon$, helps to avoid this indeterminate form in the $\frac{0}{0}$ case.
