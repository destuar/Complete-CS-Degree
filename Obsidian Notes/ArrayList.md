**In [[Java]], an `ArrayList` is a resizable [[array]]-like data structure. It provides dynamic resizing and allows elements to be added or removed without worrying about the underlying array's size.**

Note... ArrayLists cannot normally store primitive data types. Instead, wrapper class alternatives must be used for integers, doubles, boolean, etc.

`ArrayList<String> myArrayList = new ArrayList<String>();`

- A variable type that represents a list of items.
- You can access individual items in an array by *index*.
- Stores a single type of **object** (String, GRect, etc.).
- Resizable - can add and remove elements.
- Has helpful methods for searching items. 

In [[Python]], the equivalent to an ArrayList is simply the `list`, where dynamic resizing is built-in and allows for flexible methods for adding/removing elements.
