The **modulus** operator (`%`) is a mathematical operator in programming that returns the **remainder** of a division between two numbers. It's useful in a variety of scenarios, such as determining even or odd numbers, cycling through sequences, or performing operations that require wrap-around logic.
### Basic Usage of the Modulus Operator

In [[Java]] (and many other languages), the syntax for modulus is:

`int remainder = dividend % divisor;`

- **dividend**: The number being divided.
- **divisor**: The number by which we are dividing.
- **remainder**: The result of the modulus operation.
