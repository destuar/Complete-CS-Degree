In [[Java]], [[Python]], and [[C++]], **operator precedence** determines the order in which different types of operations are evaluated in an expression. The precedence order is generally:

**arithmetic > relational > logical**

This means:
1. **Arithmetic operators** (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`) are evaluated first.
2. **Relational operators** (`>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `==`, `!=`) are evaluated next.
3. **Logical operators** (`&&`, `||`, `!`) are evaluated last.
	In Python, logical operators are `and`, `or`, and `not`, which perform similar functions.
