The network layer is responsible for routing packets of data across different networks and ensuring that they reach their destination. It handles the logical addressing of devices, packet forwarding, and the selection of paths through the network.

### Key Functions:

- **Routing:** Determines the best path for data packets to travel from the source to the destination, often using routing algorithms and protocols.
- **Logical Addressing:** Assigns [[IP address]]es to devices, allowing for identification and location within the network.
- **Packet Forwarding:** Forwards packets between routers and other devices based on the destination address.

### Key Protocols:

- **IP (Internet Protocol):** The primary protocol used for addressing and routing packets on the internet (includes IPv4 and IPv6).
- **ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol):** Used for error messages and operational information, such as network diagnostics (e.g., ping).
