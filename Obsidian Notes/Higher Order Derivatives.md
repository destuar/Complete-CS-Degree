Examples of higher order derivatives-
    f''(x) is the "second derivative", or the derivative of f'(x).
    f'''(x) is the "third derivative", or the derivative of f''(x).

When something changes over time, that change can be expressed as a [[Derivative]].

The first derivative simply tells you how much something is changing over time. 

The second derivative tells you how much the change speeds up or slows down over time. $$ f''(x) = \frac{d^2}{dx^2} f(x)$$
The third derivative tells you about sudden jumps in changing speed.$$ f'''(x) = \frac{d^3}{dx^3} f(x)$$
And, in general, the ***n*-th derivative** is written as:$$f^{(n)}(x) = \frac{d^n}{dx^n} f(x)$$
