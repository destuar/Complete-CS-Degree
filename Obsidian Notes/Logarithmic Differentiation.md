[[Logarithmic]] differentiation is a method used to differentiate functions by first taking the natural logarithm of both sides. Itâ€™s helpful for functions that are complex products, quotients, or have variable exponents, as taking the logarithm simplifies the differentiation process.

For example, the natural log of a product is a sum, and the natural log of a quotient is a difference.
