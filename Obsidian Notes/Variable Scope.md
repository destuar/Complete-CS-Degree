**[[Variable]] Scope** defines where a variable is accessible in code.

The **scope** of a variable refers to the section of code where the variable can be accessed.

Once a variable is out of scope, it can no longer be accessed, preventing accidental modifications.

2. **Scope Starts at Declaration**:
    
    - A variable's scope begins **where it is declared**.
    - This means that a variable is accessible only after its declaration and not before.
    
1. **Scope Ends with Code Block Termination**:
    
    - Scope ends at the **closing brace (`}`)** of the block in which the variable was declared.
    - This could be within a function, loop, conditional, or any block surrounded by braces `{}`.
