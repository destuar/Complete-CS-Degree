An exponential fn and a log fn with the same base "undo" each other. 
    For any base $a$, $\log_a(a^x) = x$
    For any base $a$, $a^{\log_a(x)} = x$

Product rule, Quotient rule, and Power rule all hold.
    [[Product Rule]]: The log of the product is the sum of the logs.
    [[Quotient Rule]]: The log of the quotient is the difference of the logs.
    [[Power Rule]]: When you take the log of an expression with an exponent, you can bring down the exponent and multiply.
