A **Cartesian equation** describes a curve or geometric shape in the Cartesian coordinate plane by relating the variables $x$ and $y$ using an equation $F(x, y) = 0$. Common examples include:

- **Line**: $y = mx + b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the $y$-intercept.
- **Circle**: $(x - h)^{2} + (y - k)^{2} = r^{2}$, centered at $(h, k)$ with radius $r$.
- **Ellipse**: $\frac{(x - h)^{2}}{a^{2}} + \frac{(y - k)^{2}}{b^{2}} = 1$.
- **Parabola**: $y = ax^{2} + bx + c$.
