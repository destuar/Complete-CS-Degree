The linearity of expectation states that the [[expected value]] of the sum of random variables is equal to the sum of their expected values, **regardless of whether the variables are independent or not**.

Mathematically, for any random variables $R_1, R_2, ..., R_n$​, we have:

$$E[R_1 + R_2 + \dots + R_n] = E[R_1] + E[R_2] + \dots + E[R_n]$$

More generally, for constants $a_1, a_2, ..., a_n$​:

$$E[a_1 R_1 + a_2 R_2 + \dots + a_n R_n] = a_1 E[R_1] + a_2 E[R_2] + \dots + a_n E[R_n]$$
