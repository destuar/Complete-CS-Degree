If $g$ is differentiable at $x$ and $f$ is differentiable at $g(x)$, then $(f o g)$ is differentiable at $x$ and $(f o g)'(x) = f'(g(x)) * g'(x)$.

For example, the [[Derivative]] of a function $h(x) = (sin(x))^{\frac12}$ can be evaluated as $h'(x) = f'(g(x)) * g'(x)$ or $h'(x) = \frac12(sin(x))^{-\frac12} * cos(x)$.

In addition, the derivative of $f'(x) = a^x$ is equal to $ln(a)*a^x$.
