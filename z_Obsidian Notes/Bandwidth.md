In practice, bandwidth refers to the speed of the [[Internet]] network. 

Bandwidth refers to the maximum rate of data transfer across a network path or the capacity of a communication channel. It is typically measured in [[Bit]]s per second (bps) and indicates how much data can be transmitted in a given amount of time.

In the context of internet connections, higher bandwidth means that more data can be sent and received simultaneously, leading to faster download and upload speeds. However, it's important to note that bandwidth is just one factor affecting overall network performance; [[Latency]] and network congestion can also impact the user experience.

Bandwidth can also refer to the range of frequencies used in signal transmission, with a wider bandwidth allowing for a larger number of signals or a higher quality of transmission, such as in audio or video communications.
