If $f$ has a local max or min at $x = c$, then $c$ must be a critical number for $f$. At these critical points, the [[Derivative]] of $f(x)$, $f'(x)$, is either equal to 0 or does not exist (DNE).

Conversely, just because the derivative of $f(x) = 0$ or DNE does not mean that this is a local max or min.
