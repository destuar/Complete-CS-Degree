$f(x)$ has an inflection point at $x = c$ if $f(x)$ is continuous at $c$ and it chances concavity at $c$. This means that $f$ changes from concave up to concave down at $x = c$, or vice versa. 

If $f''(x)$ changes sign at $x = c$, then $f$ has an inflection point at $x = c$. Note that if $f''(c) = 0$ or DNE, that does not guarantee an inflection point (ex. $f(x) = x^2$ does not have an inflection point).
