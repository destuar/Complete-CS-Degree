**TLDR: Use a for loop when you know how many times you want a block of code repeatedly executed. Use a [[While Loop]] when you don't know how many times.**

Executes code repeatedly based on a specified condition. It's useful when you know how many times you want to execute a statement or a block of statements.
### Basic Syntax:

`for (initialization; condition; update) {     // code to be executed 
`}`

1. **Initialization**: Sets a loop control variable (often an integer) to an initial value. This only runs once at the start of the loop.
2. **Condition**: The loop continues to execute as long as this condition is `true`. Once itâ€™s `false`, the loop stops.
3. **Update**: Updates the loop control variable after each iteration, typically incrementing or decrementing it.
