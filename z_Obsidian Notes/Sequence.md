**A sequence is an ordered [[collection]] or list of numbers. Each number in the sequence is called a term, and the sequence is typically denoted as ${a_n}$, where $a_n$ represents the $n$th term.**

### **Definition**

A sequence ${a_n}$ is a function whose domain is the set of positive integers $\mathbb{N}$, and its range is a set of real or complex numbers. The $n$th term of the sequence is defined explicitly or recursively.

### **Examples**

1. **Explicit Sequence**: The sequence ${a_n}$ where $a_n = \frac{1}{n}$ is: 
   $\{a_n\} = \left\{ 1, \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{4}, \dots \right\}$

2. **Recursive Sequence**: The Fibonacci sequence ${a_n}$ is defined recursively as: $a1=1, a2=1, an=an−1+an−2 for n≥3$

### **Convergence of a Sequence**

A sequence ${a_n}$ converges to a limit $L$ if: $\lim_{n \to \infty} a_n = L$

If no such $L$ exists, the sequence diverges.

**Increasing**: A sequence $a_{n}$ is increasing if $a_{n} < a_{n+1}$ for all $n$.

**Non-decreasing**: A sequence $a_{n}$ is non-decreasing if $a_{n} \leq a_{n+1}$ for all $n$.

**Decreasing**: A sequence $a_{n}$ is decreasing if $a_{n} > a_{n+1}$ for all $n$.

**Non-increasing**: A sequence $a_{n}$ is non-increasing if $a_{n} \geq a_{n+1}$ for all $n$.

**Monotonic**: A sequence is monotonic if it is either non-decreasing or non-increasing.
