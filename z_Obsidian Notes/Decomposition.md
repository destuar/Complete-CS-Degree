**Start from a large task and break it up into smaller pieces.**

The practice of breaking down a complex problem into smaller, more manageable sub-problems, making it easier to understand, develop, and debug. Promotes modular, reusable code and helps tackle complex challenges in steps.

### Key Principles of Decomposition

1. **Single Responsibility**:
    - Each decomposed function or method should solve one distinct problem or task. Aim for smaller code segments, typically under 20 lines, to maintain clarity.
    - For example, instead of writing one large method, break it into smaller functions with clear, focused purposes.
    
2. **Descriptive Naming**:
    - Each function or method should have a descriptive name that clearly indicates what it does. This helps others (and your future self) understand the code without needing extensive documentation.
    
3. **Documentation and Comments**:
    - Well-commented code is essential. Explain the purpose of each function, parameters, and any complex logic within it.
    - Comments are particularly valuable for describing why a function is necessary, its input/output, and any edge cases it handles.
