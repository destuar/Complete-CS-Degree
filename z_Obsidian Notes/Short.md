A short is typically **2 bytes (16 bits)** in memory.

## Key Characteristics

- **Size**: 2 bytes or 16 bits
- **Possible Values**: Can distinguish between 2^16 (65,536) different values
- **Sign Bit**: The leftmost bit is used as a sign bit, allowing for both positive and negative numbers
- **Range**: Using two's complement representation
  - Signed: -32,768 to 32,767
  - Unsigned: 0 to 65,535
