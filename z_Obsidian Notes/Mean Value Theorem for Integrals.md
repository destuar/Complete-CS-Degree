The [[Mean Value Theorem]] for [[Integral]]s states that if $f(x)$ is continuous on the closed interval $[a, b]$, then there exists at least one point $c$ in $[a,b]$ such that:

$\int_a^b f(x) , dx = f(c) (b-a)$

---
### Solving for $f(c)$

Rearranging for $f(c)$, we see that $f(c)$ is the **average value** of the function over $[a,b]$:

$f(c) = \frac{1}{b-a} \int_a^b f(x) , dx$

This shows that the Mean Value [[Theorem]] for Integrals guarantees the existence of a point $c$ where the function's value equals its average value over the interval.
