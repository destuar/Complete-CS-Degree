# Online Transaction Processing (OLTP)

## Definition

**OLTP** systems handle day-to-day operational transactions in databases, designed for high-volume, real-time transaction processing.

## Characteristics

**Short, Simple Transactions**: Quick queries and updates
- Touches small portions of data per transaction
- **Frequent Updates**: Constant data modifications
- Examples: Account balance updates, order processing, page view logging

## Typical Operations

- **INSERT**: Add new records (orders, customers, transactions)
- **UPDATE**: Modify existing records (account balances, inventory)
- **DELETE**: Remove records (cancel orders)
- **SELECT**: Read specific records (lookup customer info)

## Data Flow

OLTP systems serve as **operational data sources** that feed into:
- Data warehouses for analysis
- OLAP systems for decision support
- Reporting systems

## Performance Optimization

- **Indexing**: Fast lookups for individual records
- **Normalization**: Minimize redundancy, ensure data integrity
- **Transaction Management**: ACID properties for consistency
- **Concurrency Control**: Handle multiple simultaneous users

## Use Cases

- Banking systems (ATM transactions, transfers)
- E-commerce (order placement, inventory management)
- Airline reservations
- Point-of-sale systems
- Customer relationship management (CRM)
