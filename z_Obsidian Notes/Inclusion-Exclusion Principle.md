# Inclusion-Exclusion Principle

**A fundamental rule for "counting with ORs."**

The Inclusion-Exclusion Principle is a more general and fundamental rule for counting outcomes that can come from multiple sets, especially when there might be overlap between those sets.

## The Principle

When you want to count outcomes that can come from **Set A OR Set B**, the principle states:

$$|A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \cap B|$$

In words:
1. **Add** the number of outcomes in Set A
2. **Add** the number of outcomes in Set B
3. **Subtract** the number of outcomes that are in both Set A and Set B

## Why Subtract the Overlap?

The subtraction step is crucial to **avoid double-counting**. Elements that appear in both sets would be counted twice if we simply added |A| + |B|, so we must subtract the intersection once to get the correct count.

## Example

Suppose you're counting students who take either Math OR Computer Science:
- Set A (Math students): 30 students
- Set B (CS students): 25 students  
- Set A âˆ© B (Both Math and CS): 10 students

Using Inclusion-Exclusion:
$$|A \cup B| = 30 + 25 - 10 = 45 \text{ students}$$

Without subtracting the overlap, we would incorrectly count 55 students (counting the 10 overlapping students twice).

## General Form

For three or more sets, the principle extends:
$$|A \cup B \cup C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A \cap B| - |A \cap C| - |B \cap C| + |A \cap B \cap C|$$

The pattern alternates between adding and subtracting terms of increasing intersection sizes.
