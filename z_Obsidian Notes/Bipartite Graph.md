A **bipartite graph** is a type of [[graph]] where the set of vertices can be divided into **two disjoint sets** $U$ and $V$ such that **no two vertices within the same set are adjacent**.

Formally, a graph $G = (V, E)$ is **bipartite** if its vertex set $V$ can be partitioned into two sets $U$ and $V$, where every edge in $E$ connects a vertex in $U$ to a vertex in $V$.
