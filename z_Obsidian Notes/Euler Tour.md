An **Euler Tour (or Eulerian Circuit)** in a [[graph]] is a **closed walk** that visits every edge **exactly once** and returns to the starting vertex.

A graph containing an Euler Tour is called an **Eulerian Graph**.

**Conditions for an Euler Tour (Eulerian Circuit)**

A **connected** graph has an **Euler Tour** if and only if:

1. **Every vertex has an even degree** (i.e., each vertex has an even number of edges).
2. **The graph is connected** (i.e., every vertex is reachable from any other vertex).
