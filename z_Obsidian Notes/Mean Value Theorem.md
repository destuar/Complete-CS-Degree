The Mean Value Theorem (MVT) for functions states that, 

If $g(x)$ is continuous on $[$a, $b$], and differentiable on ($a$, $b$), then there is some $c$ in ($a$, $b$) such that the [[Derivative]] of  $g$ at $c$ is equal to the average rate of change of $g$ across the entire interval, $g'(c) = \frac{g(b) - g(a)}{b - a}$.

The Mean Value Theorem (MVT) for integrals states the same proof as for functions, where the function is instead an [[Integral]]. We consider a continuous function $f(x)$ on the interval $[$a, $b$]. The theorem states that there exists a point $c$ in ($a$, $b$) such that the value of $f(c)$ is equal to the average value of $f(c)$ over the interval. This can be written as: $$f(c) = \frac{1}{b-a} \int_{a}^{b}{f(x) \, dx}$$

The point of the Mean Value Theorem (MVT)—both for derivatives and integrals—is to ensure that a function behaves in a certain "average" way at least at one point within an interval. This insight is foundational in calculus, explaining how continuous and differentiable functions relate locally and globally.
