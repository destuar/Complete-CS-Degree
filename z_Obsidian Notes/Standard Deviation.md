The standard deviation of a random variable $R$ measures the **average deviation from the expected value (mean)**. It is the **square root of [[variance]]**, making it easier to interpret since it has the same units as $R$.

Mathematically, standard deviation is defined as:

$$\sigma_R = \sqrt{\text{Var}(R)}$$

where:

$$\text{Var}(R) = E[(R - E[R])^2]$$
