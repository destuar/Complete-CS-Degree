**There are multiple definitions of Vectors, depending on the context.**

In [[C++]], a Vector [[collection]] is simply a dynamic [[array]] (or an [[ArrayList]] in [[Java]]). This can look like a standard array or a Grid (similar to a [[2D Array]] in Java) and *automatically resizes itself as elements are added or removed*.
