Because [[Bit]]s and [[Byte]]s operate in powers of 2, we can also represent higher orders in this way.

1 kilobyte = $2^{10}$ = $1,024$
1 megabyte = $2^{20}$ = $1,048,576$
1 gigabyte = $2^{30}$ = $1,073,741,824$
1 terabyte = $2^{40}$ = $1,099,511,627,776$

Peta = $2^{50}$, Exa = $2^{60}$, Zetta = $2^{70}$, Yotta = $2^{80}$

There is some disagreement between EE and CS, where a kilobyte may refer to $1,000$ and megabyte as $1,000,000$.
