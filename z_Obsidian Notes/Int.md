# Int

An int can be anywhere between 2 and 4 bytes, but **in this class, it's considered 4 bytes (32 bits)**.

## Key Characteristics

- **Size**: 4 bytes or 32 bits (in this course context)
- **Possible Values**: Can distinguish between 2^32 (4,294,967,296) different values
- **Representation**: Uses two's complement for negative numbers
- **Sign Bit**: The leftmost bit indicates the sign
- **Range**: Using two's complement representation
  - Signed: -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647
  - Unsigned: 0 to 4,294,967,295
