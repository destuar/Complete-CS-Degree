Pairwise independence means that in a collection of events, any two events are independent, but the entire set of events may **not** be mutually independent.

Formally, a set of events $A_1, A_2, ..., A_n$â€‹ is **pairwise independent** if for all pairs $A_i, A_j$ with $i \neq j$:

$$P(A_i \cap A_j) = P(A_i) P(A_j)$$

Knowing whether one event happens does not change the probability of the other event happening, but this condition only applies to pairs and does not extend to all subsets.
