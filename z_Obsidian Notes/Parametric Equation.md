A **parametric equation** for a curve gives both $x$ and $y$ as functions of a third variable (usually $t$). The third variable is called a **parameter**. Instead of describing $y$ directly as a function of $x$, we write:

- $x = x(t)$
- $y = y(t)$

**Examples**
- **Line**: $x(t) = x_{0} + at$ and $y(t) = y_{0} + bt$ for constants $x_{0}$, $y_{0}$, $a$, and $b$.
- **Circle**: $x(t) = h + r \cos(t)$ and $y(t) = k + r \sin(t)$, with center $(h, k)$ and radius `$r$`.

**Advantages**
- **Flexibility**: Parametric equations can describe more complicated curves, such as loops or multiple $y$ values for the same $x$.
- **Calculus Applications**: Derivatives of $x(t)$ and $y(t)$ help compute slopes, arc lengths, and areas.
- **Motion and Physics**: They naturally represent trajectories where $t$ is time and $x(t)$, $y(t)$ give positions.
