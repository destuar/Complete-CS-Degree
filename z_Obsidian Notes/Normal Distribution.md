The Normal Distribution (Gaussian Distribution) is a continuous probability distribution that is symmetric about its mean and follows a characteristic bell-shaped curve. It is one of the most important probability distributions in statistics.

### Mathematical Definition

The probability density function (PDF) of a normal distribution is:

$$f(x|\mu,\sigma^2) = \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}}$$

where:
- $\mu$ is the mean (location parameter)
- $\sigma^2$ is the variance (scale parameter)
- $\sigma$ is the standard deviation

### Properties

1. **Shape Characteristics**
   - Symmetric about the mean
   - Bell-shaped curve
   - Asymptotic to the x-axis
   - Mean = Median = Mode

2. **Empirical Rule (68-95-99.7)**
   - 68% of data within $\mu \pm 1\sigma$
   - 95% of data within $\mu \pm 2\sigma$
   - 99.7% of data within $\mu \pm 3\sigma$

3. **Standard Normal Distribution**
   - When $\mu = 0$ and $\sigma = 1$
   - Z-score transformation: $Z = \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma}$
   - Used for standardization and comparison
