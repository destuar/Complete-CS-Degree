A recursively defined [[sequence]] specifies each term in relation to one or more previous terms. For instance, an arithmetic sequence can be written as  
$a_{n} = a_{n-1} + d$  

with an initial term $a_{1}$. A geometric sequence can be written as  
$a_{n} = r \cdot a_{n-1}$.  

In both cases, knowing $a_{1}$ and the recursion rule uniquely determines all terms of the sequence. More generally, a recurrence relation might involve several previous terms, such as  $$a_{n} = f\bigl(a_{n-1}, a_{n-2}, \dots\bigr)$$which likewise requires corresponding initial conditions to define the sequence completely.
