Newtonâ€™s Method iteratively approximates the root (zero) of a function $f(x)$ by starting with an initial guess and applying the formula: $$x_{n+1} = x_{n} - \frac{f(x_{n})}{f'(x_{n})}$$
This converges to a solution where $f(x) = 0$ or the "root". The steps of this convergence are as follows:
1. Make a guess
2. Find the [[Tangent Line]] to that point
3. Find the x-intercept for the tangent line
4. Repeat until the approx. is close enough to $f(x) = 0$

This relates to the [[Max & Min Values]] and [[Critical Numbers]] because the min/max is where the slope (or [[Derivative]]) of the function equals zero, meaning $f(x)=0$ and a flat tangent line... *potentially* an extreme point.
