Key Fact: an inverse function essentially "reverses" the effect of a given function. If $f(x)$ is a function that maps an input $x$ to an output $y$, the inverse function, denoted as $f^{âˆ’1}(x)$, will take $y$ as input and return $x$ as output.

Key Fact: the graph of $y = f^{-1}(x)$ is obtained by reflecting $y = f(x)$ over the line $y = x$.

Key Fact: $f^{-1}$ of $f(x) = x$ and $f$ of $f^{-1}$ of $f(x) = x$. This is the mathematical way of saying that $f$ and $f^{-1}$ undo each other.

Note that not all functions have an inverse function (ex. $x^2$) because they do not pass the horizontal line test.
