A Hasse diagram is a simplified directed acyclic [[graph]] (DAG) that visually represents a partially ordered [[set]] (poset). 

It removes redundant edges (transitive edges) and arranges elements vertically based on order relationships.

In this clothing dependency example, the Hasse diagram represents a partial order of dressing, where:

- Each item must be worn **before** another item if an arrow exists.
- Items are **positioned above** their dependencies.
