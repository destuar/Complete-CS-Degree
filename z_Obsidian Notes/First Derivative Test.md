If f is a continuous function near $x = c$ and if $c$ is a critical number, then we can decide if f has a local max or min at $x = c$ by looking at the [[Derivative]] of $f$ at $x = c$.

If the derivative of $f$ is positive or negative on both sides of $c$, then there is no local extreme point (max or min). Instead, this occurs when one side of $c$ is positive and the other is negative.
