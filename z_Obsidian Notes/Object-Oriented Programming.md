Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is centered around objectsâ€”entities that combine data (attributes) and behavior (methods). OOP emphasizes modularity, code reusability, and a structured approach to software design.

**Core Principles of OOP**:
1. **Encapsulation**: The bundling of data and methods within an object, restricting access to certain details. This promotes data security and prevents unintended interference.
2. **Abstraction**: The concept of simplifying complex systems by hiding implementation details and exposing only the necessary parts.
3. **Inheritance**: The ability of a new class (subclass) to inherit attributes and methods from an existing class (superclass), facilitating code reuse and hierarchy.
4. **Polymorphism**: The ability of different objects to respond uniquely to the same operation or method call, typically achieved through method overriding or overloading.

**Advantages of OOP**:
- **Modularity**: Code is organized around objects, making it easier to manage, understand, and modify.
- **Reusability**: Code written for one object can often be reused with other objects.
- **Scalability**: New objects or classes can be added with minimal impact on existing code.
- **Maintainability**: OOP promotes well-organized code, reducing the likelihood of errors and making debugging easier.

**Applications of OOP**: OOP is widely used in software development, especially for large and complex applications. It is the foundation for many modern programming languages, including [[Java]], [[C++]], [[Python]], and **C#**.
