**An examination of the elements of a [[Binary Tree]].**
- A pattern used in many tree algorithms and methods

Common orderings for traversals:
- **pre-order**: process root node, then its left, right subtrees
- **in-order**: process left subtree, then root node, then right
- **post-order**: process left, right subtrees, then root node

Can be used to implement a [[Binary Search Tree]].
