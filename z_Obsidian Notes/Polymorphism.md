**Ability for the same code to be used with different types of objects and behave differently with each.**

*Idea*: Client code can call a method on different kinds of objects, and the resulting behavior will be different.

Examples:
- `println` can accept any type of parameter and print it.
- A `GraphicsProgram` can add any type of graphical object to itself.
