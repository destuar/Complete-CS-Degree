In an example of motion at time $t$ given by the function $s(t)$, the velocity can be given by $s'(t)$ (direction of the motion at a given time, $t$) and the acceleration can be given by $s''(t)$ (the rate in which the velocity is changing).

For this example, speed can be interpreted as the absolute value of velocity, $s'(t)$.
