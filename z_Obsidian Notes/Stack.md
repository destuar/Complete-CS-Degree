**A [[collection]] based on the principle of adding elements and retrieving them in the opposite order.** 
- Last-In, First-Out ("LIFO")
- Client can only add/remove/examine the last element added (the "top").

- Basic stack operations:
	- `push`: Add an element to the top.
	- `pop`: Remove the top element.
	- `peek`: Examine the top element.

Example:
The "undo" button is built on a stack, where actions are LIFO and pushed or popped accordingly.
