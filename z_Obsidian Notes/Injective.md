A function $f:A→B$ is **injective** (or **one-to-one**) if **each element in the codomain $B$ has at most one preimage in the domain $A$**.

In other words, if:
$$f(a1)=f(a2)⇒a1=a2$$
This means **no two different elements in $A$ map to the same element in $B$**.

[[Cardinality]] is **LESS THAN OR EQUAL** in bijective [[set]]s from $X$ to $Y$.
