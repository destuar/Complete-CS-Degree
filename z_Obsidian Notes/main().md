**The main() function serves different roles in each programming language, but all act as a way to standardize how programs start.**

### [[Java]]
- The `main()` method is the starting point of a Java application.

	`public class Main {
	    `public static void main(String[] args) {
	        `System.out.println("Hello, World!");
	    `}
	`}

- **Modifiers**:
        - `public`: Accessible by the JVM from anywhere.
        - `static`: Allows the JVM to call it without creating an object.
        - `void`: No return value is required.
    - `String[] args`: Takes command-line arguments as an array of `String`.

- **Behavior**:
    - Looks for this specific signature (`public static void main(String[] args)`) to start the program.

### [[C++]]
- The `main()` function is mandatory and serves as the entry point for program execution.

	`#include <iostream>
	`using namespace std;
	
	`int main() {
	    `cout << "Hello, World!" << endl;
	    `return 0;  // Optional, but signals successful execution
	`}`

- **Return Type**:
    - `int`: Indicates the exit status of the program. Returning `0` signifies successful execution.

- **Arguments** (Optional):
    - `int argc`: Count of command-line arguments.
    - `char* argv[]`: Array of command-line arguments as strings.

- **Behavior**:
    - The program execution begins and ends with `main()`.

### [[Python]]
- While Python does not require a `main()` function, it's a common convention to define one for better structure and modularity.

	`def main():
	    `print("Hello, World!")
	
	`if __name__ == "__main__":
	    `main()

- Python scripts execute code at the top level by default, but using `main()`:
    - Improves readability.
    - Prevents code from running unintentionally when the file is imported as a module.
- `__name__ == "__main__"`:
    - Ensures `main()` is executed only when the file is run directly, not when imported.
