**Maximal Margin Classifier** is the simplest form of [[Support Vector Machines]] that separates linearly separable classes by finding the hyperplane with the largest margin between classes. It forms the theoretical foundation for more complex support vector methods.

### Mathematical Framework
For a binary classification problem:

$f(x) = \text{sign}(\beta_0 + \beta^T x)$

subject to:
$y_i(\beta_0 + \beta^T x_i) \geq 1$ for all $i$

where:
- $\beta_0$ is the intercept
- $\beta$ is the normal vector to the hyperplane
- $y_i \in \{-1, 1\}$ are class labels
- $x_i$ are feature vectors

### Optimization Problem
1. **Primal Form**
   $\min_{\beta_0, \beta} \frac{1}{2}\|\beta\|^2$
   subject to $y_i(\beta_0 + \beta^T x_i) \geq 1$ for all $i$

2. **Dual Form**
   $\max_{\alpha} \sum_{i=1}^n \alpha_i - \frac{1}{2}\sum_{i=1}^n\sum_{j=1}^n \alpha_i\alpha_j y_i y_j x_i^T x_j$
   subject to $\alpha_i \geq 0$ and $\sum_{i=1}^n \alpha_i y_i = 0$

### Properties
1. **Margin**
   - Width = $\frac{2}{\|\beta\|}$
   - Determined by support vectors
   - Maximum separation
   - Geometric interpretation

2. **Support Vectors**
   - Points on margin boundaries
   - Determine decision boundary
   - Sparse solution
   - Critical for classification

### Limitations
1. **Applicability**
   - Requires linear separability
   - Sensitive to outliers
   - No probabilistic output
   - Limited flexibility

2. **Extensions Needed**
   - Soft margins for overlap
   - Kernel methods for nonlinearity
   - Regularization for robustness
   - Probability calibration

### Relationship to Other Methods
