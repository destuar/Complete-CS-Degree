**In programming, a variable can be thought of as a "box" for storing different data.**

- **Container**: Just like a box can hold items, a variable can store different types of data, such as numbers, text, or objects.
- **Label**: Each variable has a name (like labeling a box), allowing you to access and manipulate its contents easily.
- **Storage**: Variables hold values temporarily in memory, so you can change, retrieve, or update the data during program execution.

Variables Types include:
	**int** - an integer number
	**double** - a decimal number (also called **float**)
	**char** - a single character
	**boolean** - true or false
