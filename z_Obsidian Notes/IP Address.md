**This is a naming system used to identify computers across a network.** 

An IP address (Internet Protocol address) is a unique identifier assigned to each device connected to a computer network that uses the [[Internet]] Protocol for communication. It serves two main functions:

1. **Identification:** It identifies the host or network interface of the device, allowing it to be distinguished from other devices on the network.
    
2. **Location Addressing:** It indicates the location of the device in the network, helping to route data packets to the correct destination.
    

IP addresses come in two main versions:

1. **IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4):** This is the most widely used version and consists of four sets of numbers separated by periods, such as `192.168.1.1`. Each set can range from 0 to 255, providing approximately 4.3 billion unique addresses.
    
2. **IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6):** Developed to address the limitations of IPv4, IPv6 uses a longer address format composed of eight groups of four hexadecimal digits, separated by colons, such as `2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334`. IPv6 allows for a vastly larger number of unique addresses, accommodating the growing number of devices connected to the internet.
    

IP addresses can be **static** (fixed and do not change) or **dynamic** (assigned by a DHCP server and can change periodically). They can also be classified into different types based on their function:

- **Public IP Address:** An address that is accessible from the internet and is used for communication between devices over the internet.
    
- **Private IP Address:** An address used within a local network that is not routable on the internet, allowing multiple devices to connect to the same public IP address.
    
- **Loopback IP Address:** A special address (commonly `127.0.0.1`) used to refer to the local device, often used for testing purposes.
