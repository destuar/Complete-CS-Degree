An arithmetic [[sequence]] is one in which the difference between consecutive terms is constant. This constant is called the common difference $d$. The $n$th term of an arithmetic sequence is  
$a_{n} = a_{1} + (n - 1)d$.  

The sum of the first $n$ terms is  
$S_{n} = \frac{n}{2} \bigl(a_{1} + a_{n}\bigr)$,  

which can also be written as  
$S_{n} = \frac{n}{2} \bigl(2a_{1} + (n - 1)d\bigr)$.
