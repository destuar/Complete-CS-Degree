Linear combination refers to an expression formed by multiplying each of a set of [[vector]]s by a corresponding [[scalar]], then summing the results.

Suppose you have vectors $\mathbf{v}_1, \mathbf{v}_2, \ldots, \mathbf{v}_k$ in a vector space (for example, in $\mathbb{R}^n$), and scalars $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_k$ (for instance, real numbers). A **linear combination** of these vectors is given by:

$a_1 \mathbf{v}_1 + a_2 \mathbf{v}_2 + \cdots + a_k \mathbf{v}_k.$

For example, if $\mathbf{v}_1 = (1, 2)$ and $\mathbf{v}_2 = (3, -1)$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$, and your scalars are $2$ and $-3$, then:

$2 \mathbf{v}_1 \;+\; (-3) \mathbf{v}_2 \;=\; 2(1, 2) \;+\; (-3)(3, -1) \;=\; (2, 4) \;+\; (-9, 3) \;=\; (-7, 7).$

### Geometric Interpretation

1. **Scaling & Adding**: Each vector is first scaled (multiplied by a scalar), and the results are then added together.
2. **Span**: The set of *all possible* linear combinations of $\mathbf{v}_1, \ldots, \mathbf{v}_k$ is called the **span** of those vectors. Geometrically, it represents all points you can reach by “scaling and adding” those vectors.
