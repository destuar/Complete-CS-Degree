The **Binomial Theorem** provides a formula for expanding expressions of the form:

$$(x + y)^n$$

where $n$ is a non-negative integer. The expansion follows:

$$(x + y)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} x^{n-k} y^k$$

where:

- $\binom{n}{k}$ is the **binomial coefficient**, given by:
    $$\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$$
    
- $x^{n-k} y^k$ are the terms in the expansion.
