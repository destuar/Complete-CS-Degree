**A [[collection]] of unique values (no duplicates allowed) that can perform the following operations efficiently:**
- add, remove, search (contains)

- We don't think of a set as having any indexes; we just add things to the set in general and don't worry about order.

- Implemented using a liked structure called a [[Binary Tree]]
	- *pretty fast*; elements are stored in a sorted order
	- values must have a `<` operation
