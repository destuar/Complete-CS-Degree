A **state machine** (also called a **finite state machine**, FSM) is a computational model used to represent a system that transitions between **finite states** based on inputs.

**Key Components of a State Machine**

1. **States** – Distinct configurations the system can be in.
2. **Transitions** – Rules that define how the system moves from one state to another.
3. **Inputs** – Events or conditions that trigger transitions.
4. **Initial State** – The state in which the system starts.
5. **(Optional) Final States** – Some state machines have specific end states.
