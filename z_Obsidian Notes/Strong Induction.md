Strong induction (also called **complete induction**) is a proof technique similar to mathematical [[induction]] but with a slight modification: instead of assuming only the previous case is true, we assume **all previous cases are true** to prove the next step.

 **Standard Induction vs. Strong Induction**

- **Standard induction**: Assume $P(n)$ is true to prove $P(n+1)$.
- **Strong induction**: Assume **all** previous cases $P(1),P(2),...,P(n)$ are true to prove $P(n+1)$.
