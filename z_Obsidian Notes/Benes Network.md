A **Benes Network** is a rearrangeable, non-blocking switching network used in telecommunications, interconnection networks, and parallel computing. It is an extension of the **[[Butterfly Network]]** with an additional set of stages, allowing **full permutation routing**.

This is essentially **two back-to-back Butterfly Networks**, which allows **any permutation of inputs to outputs**.
