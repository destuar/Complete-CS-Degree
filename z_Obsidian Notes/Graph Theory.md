**Graph theory** is a branch of mathematics that studies the relationships between objects using **graphs**. A **[[graph]]** consists of:

- **Vertices (Nodes)**: Represent entities (e.g., people, cities, routers).
- **Edges (Links)**: Represent connections between vertices (e.g., friendships, roads, network links).

A graph is typically written as:
$$G = (V, E)$$
where $V$ is the set of vertices and $E$ is the set of edges.
