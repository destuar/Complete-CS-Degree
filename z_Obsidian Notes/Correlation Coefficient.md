Using the **cosine of the angle** between two [[vector]]s in high-dimensional space, if we treat two variables as centered vectors (mean-subtracted), their correlation can be expressed as:

$$r = \cos(\theta)$$

where $\theta$ is the angle between the two vectors in **standardized** form. This means that if $r=1$, the vectors are in the same direction, and if $r=âˆ’1$, they are in opposite directions.
