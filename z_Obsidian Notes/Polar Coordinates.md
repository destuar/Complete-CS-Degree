**Polar Coordinates** use a distance $r$ (from the origin) and an angle $\theta$ (from the positive $x$-axis) to locate points in the plane:

- **Definition**: A point in polar form is given by $\bigl(r, \theta\bigr)$, where $r \geq 0$ and $\theta$ is typically measured in radians.

- **Conversions**:
    - From polar to Cartesian:  
        $x = r \cos(\theta)$ and $y = r \sin(\theta)$.
    - From Cartesian to polar:  
        $r = \sqrt{x^{2} + y^{2}}$ and $\theta = \arctan!\bigl(\tfrac{y}{x}\bigr)$ (with quadrant checks).

- **Advantages**:
    - Simplifies equations for curves with circular or radial symmetry (e.g., a circle centered at the origin can be written as $r = \text{constant}$).
    - Useful in integration, particularly for regions that are naturally circular or radial.

- **Common Curves in Polar Form**:
    - Circle with radius $a$ and center at origin: $r = a$.
    - Line through origin making angle $\alpha$ with $x$-axis: $\theta = \alpha$.
    - Rose curves, lima√ßons, and cardioids are more conveniently described in polar than Cartesian coordinates.
