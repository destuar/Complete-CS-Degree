**The diameter of a network is the length of the shortest path between the input and the output that are the farthest apart.**

The **network diameter** (or **graph diameter**) of a [[graph]] is the **longest shortest path** between any two nodes in the network.

Formally, in a graph $G = (V, E)$, the **diameter** is:

$$D(G) = \max_{u,v \in V} d(u, v)$$

where $d(u, v)$ is the shortest path distance between nodes $u$ and $v$.
