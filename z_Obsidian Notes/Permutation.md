A **permutation** is an **ordered arrangement** of elements from a [[set]]. Given a set $S$ with $n$ distinct elements, a permutation $\pi$ is a reordering of these elements.

**Notation:**

A permutation of $S = \{1, 2, 3\}$ can be written as:

$$\pi = (3, 1, 2)$$
which means:

- The first position gets element **3**,
- The second position gets element **1**,
- The third position gets element **2**.

**How Many Permutations Exist?**

For a set of $n$ distinct elements, the number of possible permutations is:

$$P(n) = n!$$
where $n!$ (factorial) is:
$$n! = n \times (n-1) \times (n-2) \times ... \times 1$$
