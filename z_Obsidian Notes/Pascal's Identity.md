**Pascal’s Identity** is a fundamental combinatorial formula that describes a relationship between binomial coefficients. It states that for any integers $n$ and $k$ where $1≤k≤n$:

$$\binom{n}{k} = \binom{n-1}{k-1} + \binom{n-1}{k}$$

This identity expresses that choosing $k$ elements from $n$ elements can be broken down into **two cases**:

1. Choosing an element (reducing both $n$ and $k$ by 1).
2. Not choosing an element (reducing $n$ but keeping $k$ the same).
