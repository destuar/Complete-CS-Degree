In mathematics, **congruence** describes a relationship between two integers $x$ and $y$ with respect to a modulus $n$. Specifically, $x$ is congruent to $y$ modulo $n$ if their difference is divisible by $n$.

This is written as:
$$x \equiv y \pmod{n}$$
and is true if and only if:
$$n \mid (x - y)$$
which means $x - y$ is divisible by $n$.
