The product rule in calculus is a way to find the [[Derivative]] of a product of two functions. 

First take the derivative of the first function and multiply it by the second function (as it is). Then, take the first function (as it is) and multiply it by the derivative of the second function. Finally, add these two results together. This combined result is the derivative of the product of the two functions.
## Product Rule:
$$\frac{d}{dx} [f(x) \cdot g(x)] = f(x) \cdot g'(x) + g(x) \cdot f'(x)$$
