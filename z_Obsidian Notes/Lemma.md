A **lemma** is a **proven statement** that serves as an intermediate step in proving a larger theorem. Lemmas are typically used to break down complex [[proof]]s into smaller, manageable parts.

 **Difference Between Lemma, Theorem, and Corollary**

| Term          | Definition                                                          |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **[[Axiom]]** | A fundamental assumption that is accepted without proof.            |
| **Lemma**     | A smaller proven result that aids in proving a larger theorem.      |
| **Theorem**   | A major proven result derived from axioms, definitions, and lemmas. |
| **Corollary** | A direct consequence of a theorem.                                  |
