A **series** is formed by summing the terms of a sequence $a_{n}$. We often write a sum in **sigma notation** using the summation symbol $\sum$. Here are some key points:

- **Finite Sum**: A finite sum of the first $N$ terms of a sequence is written as  
    $\sum_{n=1}^{N} a_{n}$,  
    which represents $a_{1} + a_{2} + \dots + a_{N}$.
    
- **Infinite Series**: An infinite series is written as  
    $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_{n}$.  
    To determine if it **converges** to a finite value or **diverges**, we look at its **partial sums**. 
    
    The $N$th partial sum is  
    $S_{N} = \sum_{n=1}^{N} a_{n}$.  
    
    If the limit of $S_{N}$ as $N$ approaches $\infty$ exists (and is finite), the series converges; otherwise, it diverges.
