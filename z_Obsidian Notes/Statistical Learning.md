**Statistical Learning** is a framework for understanding and analyzing complex data patterns through statistical methods. It encompasses both [[Supervised Learning]] and [[Unsupervised Learning]] approaches to extract meaningful insights from data.

### Core Concepts
1. **Learning Types**
   - [[Supervised Learning]]: Learning with labeled data
   - [[Unsupervised Learning]]: Learning patterns without labels
   - Semi-supervised learning: Combination of both

2. **Fundamental Trade-offs**
   - [[Bias-Variance Trade-Off]]
   - Overfitting vs. Underfitting
   - Model complexity vs. Interpretability

### Key Components
1. **Model Selection**
   - [[Cross-Validation]]
   - Information criteria (AIC, BIC)
   - Regularization methods

2. **Error Assessment**
   - Training error
   - Test error
   - Generalization error
   - Model validation

### Methods and Techniques
1. **Regression**
   - [[Linear Regression]]
   - [[Multiple Linear Regression]]
   - [[Ridge Regression]]
   - [[Lasso Regression]]

2. **Classification**
   - [[Logistic Regression]]
   - [[Linear Discriminant Analysis]]
   - [[Support Vector Machines]]
   - [[Neural Networks]]

3. **Resampling Methods**
   - [[Bootstrap]]
   - [[Cross-Validation]]
   - Jackknife
   - Permutation tests

### Model Assessment
1. **Performance Metrics**
   - MSE, RMSE, MAE
   - R-squared
   - AUC-ROC
   - Precision-Recall

2. **Model Selection Criteria**
   - Parsimony
