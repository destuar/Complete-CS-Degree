**Bonferroni Method** is a simple and widely used approach for controlling the [[Family-Wise Error Rate]] in [[Multiple Testing]] scenarios. It provides strong control of Type I errors by adjusting the significance level for individual tests.

### Mathematical Framework
For m hypothesis tests:

$\alpha_{adj} = \frac{\alpha}{m}$

where:
- $\alpha$ is overall significance level
- $m$ is number of tests
- $\alpha_{adj}$ is adjusted significance level
- Reject if $p_i \leq \alpha_{adj}$

### Properties
1. **Strong Control**
   - Controls FWER under any configuration
   - Valid for any dependency structure
   - Conservative approach
   - Simple implementation

2. **Statistical Power**
   - Decreases with number of tests
   - Loss of power with correlation
   - Trade-off with Type I error
   - Sample size implications

### Extensions
1. **Modified Procedures**
   - Holm's step-down
   - Hochberg's step-up
   - Šidák correction
   - Sequential methods

2. **Related Methods**
   - [[False Discovery Rate]]
   - [[Benjamini-Hochberg Procedure]]
   - Permutation tests
   - Resampling methods

### Advantages and Limitations
**Advantages:**
- Simple to implement
- No assumptions needed
- Strong FWER control
