**C++ is a high-performance, general-purpose programming language that supports procedural, object-oriented, and generic programming paradigms. It is widely used for applications requiring high efficiency and control over system resources.**

- **Performance**:
    - C++ is compiled directly to machine code, making it one of the fastest programming languages.
    - Ideal for applications where speed and resource optimization are critical, such as gaming, real-time systems, or simulations.

- **Control Over Hardware**:
    - Offers low-level memory management using pointers and manual allocation/deallocation (`new` and `delete`).
