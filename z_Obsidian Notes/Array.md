**A data structure that can store multiple elements of the same type in a fixed-size, ordered sequence, making them efficient for indexed data access and iteration.**

- **Benefits**:
    
    - **Fast access**: Direct access to elements by index (O(1) access time).
    - **Memory efficient**: Arrays allocate a continuous block of memory, which can be more efficient for large datasets.
    - **Iteration-friendly**: Ideal for looping through elements in sequence.
    
- **Downsides**:
    
    - **Fixed size**: Once created, the size of an array cannot be changed, limiting flexibility.
    - **Single data type**: Usually holds only one type of element (e.g., all integers or all floats).
    - **Inserting/deleting**: Adding or removing elements (especially in the middle) can be slow, as it requires shifting other elements.
