The **harmonic sum** (or **harmonic [[series]]**) is the sum of the reciprocals of the first $n$ natural numbers:

$$H_n = \sum_{k=1}^{n} \frac{1}{k}$$

where $H_n$ represents the **$n$-th harmonic number**.

### Examples of Harmonic Sums

1. $H_1 = 1$
2. $H_2 = 1 + \frac{1}{2} = 1.5$
3. $H_3 = 1 + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} \approx 1.833$
4. $H_4 = 1 + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4} \approx 2.083$

The harmonic sum **grows logarithmically**, meaning it increases indefinitely but at a very slow rate.

---
### Asymptotic Behavior

For large $n$, the harmonic sum approximates:

$$H_n \approx \ln(n) + \gamma$$

where $\gamma \approx 0.577$ is the **Euler-Mascheroni constant**.

---
### Divergence of the Harmonic Series

Even though the terms $\frac{1}{k}$ get smaller, the harmonic series **diverges**, meaning:

$$\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{k} = \infty$$

This means that even though the series grows very slowly, it has **no upper bound**.
