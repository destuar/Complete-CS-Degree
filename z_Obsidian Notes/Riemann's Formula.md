The Riemann sum formula,
$$\sum_{i=1}^{n} f(x_i^*) \Delta x$$
approximates the area under $f(x)$ on $[a ,b]$ by summing areas of rectangles using a simple $b \cdot h_{i}$ equation. As the width of these rectangles get smaller, the accuracy of the estimation increases, so for the limit as ${n \to \infty}$, this sum converges to the definite [[Integral]] $$\int_{a}^{b} f(x) \, dx.$$
connecting the Riemann sum to the exact area under the curve. $$\int_{a}^{b} f(x) \, dx = \lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{i=1}^{n} f(x_i^*) \Delta x$$
