A **matching algorithm** is used to pair elements from two sets based on specific criteria. It ensures that pairs are optimally or fairly assigned based on preferences, constraints, or efficiency.

**Stable Marriage Problem (Gale-Shapley Algorithm)**

One of the most famous matching algorithms is the **Gale-Shapley algorithm**, also known as the **Stable Marriage Algorithm**. It solves the problem of pairing $n$ men and $n$ women (or any two groups) based on ranked preferences, ensuring that no two people would prefer each other over their assigned partners.

 **How the Algorithm Works:**
1. **Each man proposes** to his most preferred woman.
2. **Each woman**:
    - Accepts the proposal if she is not already engaged.
    - If she is engaged, she compares the new suitor with her current partner:
        - If she prefers the new suitor, she switches.
        - Otherwise, she rejects the new suitor.
3. **Repeat** until every person is matched.

The algorithm **guarantees a stable matching**, meaning that **no two people would rather be with each other than their assigned partners**.
