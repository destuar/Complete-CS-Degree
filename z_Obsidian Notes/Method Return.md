**Return values let you give back some information when a method is finished... 

**The *bread* (parameter) put into the *toaster* (method) is now *toast* (return)**

The **return** keyword is used in functions or methods to exit the function and send a value back to the caller. This value is known as the **return value** and it can be of any data type, such as an integer, string, object, or even another function.

1. **Ending a Function**:
    - When `return` is called, the function immediately stops executing, and control is returned to the point where the function was called.
2. **Returning a Value**:
    - The value specified after `return` is passed back to the caller and can be used as needed.
    - The data type of the return value must match the method’s declared return type.
3. **Return Type of the Function**:
    - The function declaration specifies the return type. If the function doesn’t need to return a value, the return type is `void` (in languages like [[Java]] and [[C++]]).
    - In [[Python]], functions that don’t explicitly return a value implicitly return `None`.
