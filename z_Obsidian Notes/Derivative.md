The slope of the [[Tangent Line]] at the given point, calculated as the limit of the slope of the [[Secant Line]] as x approaches a. Written differently, f'(a) equals the limit of f(a+h) - f(a) divided by h as h approaches 0 (where h = x -a). 

### Form 1: Using \($x \to a$\)

$$
f'(a) = \lim_{{x \to a}} \frac{f(x) - f(a)}{x - a}
$$

### Form 2: Using \($h \to 0$\) (where \($h = x - a$\))

$$
f'(a) = \lim_{{h \to 0}} \frac{f(a + h) - f(a)}{h}
$$

Can be interpreted as the instantaneous rate of change at a given point, where the second point of the secant line is so close to x that the slope of the secant line is approximately equal to the slope of the tangent line.
