A function $f:A→B$ is **surjective** (or **onto**) if **every element** in the **codomain** $B$ has at least one preimage in the **domain** $A$.

In other words, for **every** $b∈B$, there exists **at least one** $a∈A$ such that:
$$f(a)=b$$
This means that the function **"covers"** all elements in $B$, though some elements in $A$ may map to the same $b$.

[[Cardinality]] is **GREATER THAN OR EQUAL** in bijective [[set]]s from $X$ to $Y$.
