When looking at a cost function for producing goods, we can use the idea of economies of scale to justify lower costs for each product at larger quantities. 

This translates into an increasing cost function $C(x)$, where the [[Derivative]], or marginal cost function, $C'(x)$ is decreasing (the rate of change decreases as quantity increases).
