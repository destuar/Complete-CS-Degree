The quotient rule in calculus helps to find the [[Derivative]] of a division of two functions. 

Take the derivative of the function in the numerator and multiply it by the function in the denominator (as it is). Then, subtract the result of taking the function in the numerator (as it is) and multiplying it by the derivative of the function in the denominator. Finally, divide this whole result by the square of the denominator function.
    1. Differentiate the top and multiply by the bottom.
    2. Subtract the top times the derivative of the bottom.
    3. Divide by the bottom squared.

## Quotient Rule:
$$\frac{d}{dx} \left( \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} \right) = \frac{g(x) \cdot f'(x) - f(x) \cdot g'(x)}{[g(x)]^2}$$
