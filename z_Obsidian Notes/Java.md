Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language developed by Sun Microsystems (now Oracle) and released in 1995. It is designed for platform independence, allowing code to be compiled into bytecode and executed on any system with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). This concept is encapsulated in Java's motto, "write once, run anywhere".

**Key Features**:
- **Object-Oriented**: Java centers around objects and classes, promoting modularity and code reuse.
- **Platform Independence**: Java bytecode runs on any system with a JVM, making it highly portable.
- **Automatic Memory Management**: Java uses a garbage collector to handle memory allocation, reducing memory leaks.
- **Strongly Typed and Safe**: Java enforces strict type-checking, reducing errors at runtime.
- **Multithreading**: Java provides inbuilt support for multi-threaded programming, enabling efficient CPU usage.
