**A [[collection]] similar to a [[set]], but is implemented using a special [[array]] called a [[Hash Table]]. 

- *very fast*; elements are stored in unpredictable order
- values must have a hashCode function (*provided for most standard types)
	- variant: LinkedHashSet (*slightly slower, but remembers insertion order*)

**USE FOR A PERFORMANCE BOOST OVER SET**
