Strategies for computing limits-
1. Factor out and cancel
2. Multiply out and cancel
3. Find the least common denominator (LCD)
4. Multiply by the conjugate of the numerator 
5. One-sided limit for absolute values

If the left-sided limit is not equal to the right-sided limits, we can say that the limit does not exist.

Limit definition of a [[Derivative]]:

$$
f'(x) = \lim_{{h \to 0}} \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}
$$

General limit notation:

$$
\lim_{{x \to a}} f(x)
$$
