The main idea behind linear approximation is to approximate a function using the [[Tangent Line]] of a point on that function for some small change in $x$. Linearization for a function, $L(x)$, is a fancy name for the tangent line.

Approximation Principle: $$f(a+\triangle{x}) \approx f(a) + f'(a)\triangle{x}$$

Linear Approximation: $$f(x) \approx f(a) + f'(a) \cdot (x - a)$$

Note: You can use this to calculate the square root of a non-perfect square.
