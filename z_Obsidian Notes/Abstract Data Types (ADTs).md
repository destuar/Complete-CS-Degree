**A specification of a [[collection]] of data and the operations that can be performed on it.**

- Describes *what* a collection can do, not *how* it does it.
- We could say that both [[Vector]] and [[LinkedList]] implement the operations of the *abstract data type* called "**list**".
	- Other examples of ADTs: [[Stack]], [[Queue]], [[Set]], [[Map]], [[Graph]]

- We don't always know exactly how a given collection is implemented internally, and we don't need to.
	- We just need to understand the idea of the collection and what operations it can perform.
	- Each implementation usually has its pros and cons.
