**A logical type whose values are true and false.** 

- A logical test is actually a boolean expression.

Like other types, it is legal to:
- Store the result of a logical test as a boolean variable
- Pass a boolean parameter or return a boolean from a method
- Call a method that returns a boolean and use it as a test
