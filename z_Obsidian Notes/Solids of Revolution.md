Using [[Integral]]s, solids of revolution can be used to model physical objects in **physics-based simulations** or **medical imaging** to analyze 3D shapes.
#### **Disk/Washer Method**

For revolution around the x-axis: $V = \pi \int_a^b \left[ R(x)^2 - r(x)^2 \right] , dx$

- $R(x)$: Outer radius
- $r(x)$: Inner radius (optional, only for the washer method)

#### **Shell Method**

For revolution around the y-axis: $V = 2\pi \int_a^b \left[ x \cdot f(x) \right] , dx$

This is useful when slicing perpendicular to the axis of revolution would be complicated.
