A **directed Hamiltonian path** is a path in a **directed [[graph]]** (digraph) that visits each vertex **exactly once** and follows the directed edges of the graph.

- The path starts at one vertex and moves along directed edges.
- Each vertex in the graph must be visited once and only once.
- Unlike Euler paths, which require visiting every edge, **Hamiltonian paths** require visiting every vertex.

**Key Points:**
- A **directed Hamiltonian path** does not necessarily return to the starting vertex.
- The **directed edges** must be followed; that is, if there is an edge from vertex $A$ to vertex $B$, the path must visit $A$ before visiting $B$.

**Hamiltonian Path vs. Eulerian Path**
- **Hamiltonian Path**: Visits every vertex **exactly once**. It is concerned with vertices, not edges. 
- **Eulerian Path**: Visits every edge **exactly once**. It is concerned with edges, not vertices. See [[Euler Tour]]
