In probability theory, a sample space (denoted as $S$ or $\Omega$) is the **set of all possible outcomes** of a random experiment. It provides a complete list of everything that **could happen** when the experiment is conducted.

**1. Finite Sample Space**
A sample space is finite if it has a limited number of outcomes.
- Example: $S={1,2,3,4,5,6}$.

**2. Infinite Sample Space**
A sample space is infinite if there are infinitely many possible outcomes.
- Example: random real number between 0 and 1 → $S=(0,1)$.

**3. Discrete Sample Space**
A discrete sample space contains a countable number of outcomes.
- Example: $S={0,1,2,3,… }$.

**4. Continuous Sample Space**
A continuous sample space contains uncountably many outcomes.
- Example: $S = \mathbb{R}^+$ (positive real numbers).
