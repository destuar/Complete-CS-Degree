**Unsupervised Learning** is a type of Machine Learning where algorithms identify patterns in unlabeled data without predefined target variables.

### Key Characteristics:
- No labeled responses or target variables
- Focuses on finding hidden patterns or structures
- Often used for exploratory data analysis
- More challenging to evaluate than [[Supervised Learning]]

### Common Methods:
1. **Clustering**
   - [[K-Means Clustering]]
   - [[Hierarchical Clustering]]
   - DBSCAN

2. **Dimensionality Reduction**
   - [[Principal Components Analysis]]
   - t-SNE
   - UMAP

3. **Association Rules**
   - Market basket analysis
   - Pattern mining

### Applications:
- Customer segmentation
- Anomaly detection
- Feature learning
- Topic modeling

### Evaluation Approaches:
- Silhouette score
- Inertia
- Explained variance
- Domain expert validation
