In graph theory, **walks** and **paths** describe sequences of vertices and edges that connect nodes in a [[graph]].

A **walk** in a graph is a sequence of vertices where **each pair of consecutive vertices is connected by an edge**.

- A **walk** can:
    - **Repeat** vertices and edges.
    - **Start and end** at the same or different vertices.


A **path** is a special type of walk where **no vertex is repeated** (except in certain special cases like a cycle).

**Properties of Paths:**
- **Simple Path** – A path that **does not repeat any vertex**.
- **Closed Path (Cycle)** – A path that **starts and ends at the same vertex**, with no other vertex repetition.
- **Shortest Path** – The path between two vertices with the minimum number of edges.
