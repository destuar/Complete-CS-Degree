**Supervised Learning** is a type of Machine Learning where the algorithm learns from labeled training data to make predictions or decisions without explicit programming.

### Key Characteristics:
- Training data includes input features (X) and target variables (Y)
- Goal is to learn a mapping function from input to output
- Model performance can be evaluated using labeled test data

### Common Types:
1. **[[Regression Model]]**
   - Continuous output variables
   - Examples: house prices, temperature predictions
   
2. **[[Classification]]**
   - Discrete output variables
   - Examples: spam detection, image classification

### Evaluation Metrics:
- Regression: MSE, RMSE, MAE, RÂ²
- Classification: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
