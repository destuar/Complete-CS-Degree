Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace and clear syntax.

### Key Features
1. **Dynamic Typing**: Variables don't need explicit declaration; type checking is done at runtime
2. **Automatic Memory Management**: Built-in garbage collection
3. **Extensive Standard Library**: "Batteries included" philosophy
4. **Multiple Programming Paradigms**:
   - Object-Oriented
   - Functional
   - Procedural
   - Imperative

### Common Data Structures
- **Lists**: `[1, 2, 3]` - Mutable sequences
- **Tuples**: `(1, 2, 3)` - Immutable sequences
- **Dictionaries**: `{'key': 'value'}` - Key-value pairs
- **Sets**: `{1, 2, 3}` - Unordered collections of unique elements

### Popular Libraries for Data Science
1. **NumPy**: Numerical computing and array operations
2. **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
3. **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: Data visualization
4. **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning
5. **TensorFlow/PyTorch**: Deep learning

### Best Practices
1. Follow PEP 8 style guide
2. Use virtual environments for project isolation
3. Write docstrings for documentation
4. Implement error handling with try/except
5. Use list comprehensions for clarity
