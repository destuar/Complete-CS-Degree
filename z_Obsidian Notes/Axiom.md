*An **axiom** is a [[proposition]] that is assumed to be True.*

Axioms are not proven but are accepted as true within a given framework.

Axioms must also be
	1. Consistent
	2. Complete

A set of axioms is **consistent** if no proposition can be proved True **and** False.

A set of axioms is **complete** if it can be used to prove every proposition is **either** True or False.
