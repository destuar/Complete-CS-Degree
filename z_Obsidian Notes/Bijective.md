A function $f:Aâ†’B$ is **bijective** if it is both **injective** (one-to-one) and **surjective** (onto). This means:

1. **[[Injective]] (One-to-One):** Each element in $B$ has **at most one** preimage in $A$.
2. **[[Surjective]] (Onto):** Each element in $B$ has **at least one** preimage in $A$.

Since both conditions hold, **each element in $B$ has exactly one preimage in $A$**. This implies that a bijective function has a well-defined **inverse function**.

[[Cardinality]] is **EQUAL** in bijective [[set]]s from $X$ to $Y$.
