Conditional probability measures the probability of an event occurring **given that another event has already occurred**. It is denoted as:

$$P(A \mid B)$$

which reads as **"the probability of $A$ given $B$"**.

It is defined mathematically as:

$$P(A \mid B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}$$

where:
- $P(A \cap B)$ is the probability that **both** events $A$ and $B$ occur.
- $P(B)$ is the probability of event $B$ occurring (assuming $P(B)>0$).

Conditional probability **narrows the [[sample space]]** to only cases where event $B$ has occurred, and then computes the likelihood of event $A$ within that new sample space.
