Measures how much a random variable deviates from its **[[expected value]] (mean)**. It quantifies the **spread** or **dispersion** of a probability distribution.

For a random variable $R$ with expected value $E[R]$, the **variance** is defined as:

$$\text{Var}(R) = E[(R - E[R])^2]$$

This formula represents the **expected squared deviation** of $R$ from its mean.
