Originally created for physics papers, HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard markup language used for creating and structuring content on the web. It allows developers to define elements such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, and other multimedia, enabling the organization of content in a way that is both human-readable and machine-readable.

### Key Features:

- **Markup Language:** Uses tags to define elements, with each tag enclosed in angle brackets (e.g., `<html>`, `<body>`, `<h1>`).
- **Structure and Semantics:** Provides a way to structure content hierarchically and semantically, enhancing accessibility and search engine optimization (SEO).
- **Hyperlinks:** Allows linking to other documents and resources, facilitating navigation across the web.
- **Multimedia Support:** Supports embedding images, videos, audio, and other media types to enrich web content.

### Versions:

- **HTML5:** The latest version, which introduces new elements and attributes for improved multimedia support, better semantics, and APIs for enhanced functionality (e.g., `<video>`, `<audio>`, `<canvas>`).

Note: 
- Almost all formatting is done on a separate style sheet using [[CSS]].
