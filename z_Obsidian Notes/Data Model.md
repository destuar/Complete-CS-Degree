# Data Model

A **Data Model** is a conceptual framework that defines how data is structured, organized, and manipulated in a database system. It provides a blueprint for representing real-world entities, relationships, and constraints, serving as the foundation for database design and implementation across different paradigms.

## Basic Definition

A data model abstracts the complexity of data storage and provides a logical view of how information is organized. It defines:

- **Data structure**: How data elements are organized and related
- **Data operations**: Valid operations for manipulating data
- **Data constraints**: Rules that ensure data integrity and consistency
- **Data semantics**: Meaning and interpretation of data elements

## Core Data Model Types

### **Set of Records Model**
- **Structure**: Data organized as collections of records with fixed or variable fields
- **Characteristics**: Each record represents an entity instance with attribute values
- **Implementation**: Traditional file systems, flat-file databases, early database systems
- **Example**: CSV files, fixed-width text files, hierarchical file structures

### **XML Model**
- **Structure**: Hierarchical tree structure with nested elements and attributes
- **Characteristics**: Self-describing, schema-optional, human-readable format
- **Implementation**: Document databases, web services, configuration files
- **Features**: Namespace support, XPath queries, XSLT transformations

### **Graph Model**
- **Structure**: Nodes (vertices) connected by edges representing relationships
- **Characteristics**: Flexible schema, relationship-centric, supports complex queries
- **Implementation**: Graph databases, social networks, knowledge graphs
- **Features**: Traversal queries, pattern matching, graph algorithms

## Mathematical Foundations

### **Set Theory Basis**
- **Records as Sets**: Each record is a set of attribute-value pairs
- **Relations as Sets**: Collections of records form mathematical relations
- **Set Operations**: Union, intersection, difference for data manipulation
- **Cardinality**: Number of elements in sets (records in collections)

### **Graph Theory Foundation**
- **Graph Representation**: $G = (V, E)$ where $V$ is vertices and $E$ is edges
- **Adjacency Matrix**: $n \times n$ matrix for $n$ vertices, $A[i][j] = 1$ if edge exists
- **Adjacency List**: Array of lists, each list contains adjacent vertices
- **Graph Traversal**: Depth-first search (DFS) and breadth-first search (BFS) algorithms

### **Tree Structures**
- **Hierarchical Organization**: Parent-child relationships in XML and hierarchical models
- **Tree Properties**: Root node, leaf nodes, internal nodes, depth, height
- **Traversal Methods**: Pre-order, in-order, post-order traversal patterns
- **Balanced Trees**: AVL trees, red-black trees for efficient operations

## Implementation Approaches

### **Set of Records Implementation**
- **Fixed-Length Records**: Uniform record size for direct access
- **Variable-Length Records**: Flexible field sizes with length indicators
- **Indexing**: B-tree indexes for efficient record retrieval
- **Storage**: Sequential files, hash files, indexed sequential files

### **XML Implementation**
- **DOM (Document Object Model)**: Tree-based in-memory representation
- **SAX (Simple API for XML)**: Event-driven streaming parser
- **XPath**: Query language for navigating XML tree structure
- **XSLT**: Transformation language for converting XML formats

### **Graph Implementation**
- **Adjacency Matrix**: $O(V^2)$ space, $O(1)$ edge lookup
- **Adjacency List**: $O(V + E)$ space, $O(degree(v))$ neighbor lookup
- **Edge List**: $O(E)$ space, $O(E)$ edge operations
- **Incidence Matrix**: $V \times E$ matrix for edge-vertex relationships

## Query Languages & Operations

### **Set of Records Queries**
- **Selection**: Filter records based on conditions
- **Projection**: Extract specific fields from records
- **Sorting**: Order records by field values
- **Aggregation**: Compute summaries across record sets

### **XML Queries**
- **XPath**: Navigate XML tree structure with path expressions
- **XQuery**: Full-featured query language for XML data
- **XSLT**: Transform XML documents between formats
- **DOM API**: Programmatic tree navigation and manipulation

### **Graph Queries**
- **Traversal**: Navigate from node to node along edges
- **Pattern Matching**: Find subgraphs matching specific patterns
- **Path Finding**: Discover routes between nodes
- **Graph Analytics**: Centrality, clustering, community detection

## Performance Characteristics

### **Time Complexity**
- **Set Operations**: $O(n)$ for linear search, $O(\log n)$ with indexing
- **XML Parsing**: $O(n)$ for SAX, $O(n)$ for DOM construction
- **Graph Traversal**: $O(V + E)$ for DFS/BFS, $O(V^2)$ for adjacency matrix

### **Space Complexity**
- **Record Storage**: $O(n \times f)$ where $n$ is records, $f$ is fields
- **XML Storage**: $O(n)$ for tree representation
- **Graph Storage**: $O(V^2)$ for adjacency matrix, $O(V + E)$ for adjacency list

### **Query Performance**
- **Set Queries**: Index-dependent, range from $O(1)$ to $O(n)$
- **XML Queries**: XPath optimization, schema-aware processing
- **Graph Queries**: Algorithm-dependent, from $O(1)$ to $O(V^3)$ for complex operations
