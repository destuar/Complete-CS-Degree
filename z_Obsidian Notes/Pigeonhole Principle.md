The **Pigeonhole Principle** states that if **$n$ objects** are placed into **$m$ containers**, and **$n > m$**, then **at least one container must contain more than one object**.

If $n$ objects are placed into $m$ containers, then at least one container must contain at least:
$$\left\lceil \frac{n}{m} \right\rceil$$
objects, where **$\lceil x \rceil$** denotes the ceiling function (rounding up to the nearest integer).

A stronger form of the Pigeonhole Principle states that if $n$ pigeons are placed into $m$ pigeonholes and $n > k \cdot m$, then at least one pigeonhole must contain more than $k$ pigeons.
