A subset of a [[graph]] that **includes all the vertices** of the graph, **is connected**, and **has no cycles**. 

It is derived from a graph (typically an undirected, connected graph) and "spans" all its vertices while maintaining minimal connections.

**Edge Count:**
- A spanning tree of a graph with $V$ vertices will have exactly $Vâˆ’1$ edges.
