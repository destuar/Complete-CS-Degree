**Encryption** is the process of converting a message $m$ into an unreadable format (ciphertext) using an encryption key $E$, so that only authorized parties with the decryption key can convert it back to the original message mmm.

Mathematically, encryption is often expressed as:

$$\text{Ciphertext} = E_{\text{key}}(m)$$
and [[decryption]] as:

$$m = D_{\text{key}}(\text{Ciphertext})$$

where $E$ and $D$ are the encryption and decryption functions, respectively.
