A geometric [[sequence]] is one in which each term is obtained by multiplying the previous term by a constant common ratio $r$. The $n$th term of a geometric sequence is  
$a_{n} = a_{1} r^{n-1}$.  

The sum of the first $n$ terms is  
$S_{n} = a_{1} \frac{1 - r^{n}}{1 - r}$,  

provided $r \neq 1$. If $|r| < 1$, the infinite sum converges to  
$S_{\infty} = \frac{a_{1}}{1 - r}$.
