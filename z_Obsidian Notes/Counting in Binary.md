**Adding binary Numbers:**
$0 + 1 = 1$
$1 + 1 = 10$
$10 + 1 = 11$
$100 + 1 = 101$
$101 + 1 = 110$
$110 + 1 = 111$

**First sixteen numbers:**
$0_{10} = 0_{2}$
$1_{10} = 1_{2}$
$2_{10} = 10_{2}$
$3_{10} = 11_{2}$
$4_{10} = 100_{2}$
$5_{10} = 101_{2}$
$6_{10} = 110_{2}$
$7_{10} = 111_{2}$
$8_{10} = 1000_{2}$
$9_{10} = 1001_{2}$
$10_{10} = 1010_{2}$
$11_{10} = 1011_{2}$
$12_{10} = 1100_{2}$
$13_{10} = 1101_{2}$
$14_{10} = 1110_{2}$
$15_{10} = 1111_{2}$

To convert a combination of [[Bit]]s to the [[Decimal Number System]], we can do the following:
$base_2$ -> $1111$
$base_{10}$ equivalent -> $8421$, or $2^3$, $2^2$, $2^1$, $2^0$

Example: $1101$ -> $8 + 4 + 0 + 1 = 16$

If we have $n$ bits, we can have $2^n$ combinations.
