A random variable is a function that assigns a numerical value to each outcome in a sample space of a probability experiment. 

A random variable is typically denoted by an uppercase letter, such as **$X$**, and it maps outcomes to real numbers:

$$X: S \to \mathbb{R}$$

where:

- $S$ is the **[[sample space]]** (set of possible outcomes).
- $\mathbb{R}$ is the set of real numbers.
- $X(s)$ represents the numerical value assigned to an outcome s∈Ss \in Ss∈S.
