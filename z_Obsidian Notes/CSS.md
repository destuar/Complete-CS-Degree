CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used for describing the presentation and visual formatting of web pages written in [[HTML]] or XML. It enables developers to control the layout, colors, fonts, and overall design of a website, enhancing the user experience and making content visually appealing.

### Key Features:

- **Separation of Content and Style:** CSS allows for the separation of content (HTML) from presentation, making it easier to maintain and update web pages.
- **Selectors and Properties:** CSS uses selectors to target HTML elements and apply styles through a set of properties (e.g., `color`, `font-size`, `margin`).
- **Cascading Effect:** Styles can cascade from multiple sources (inline styles, internal stylesheets, and external stylesheets), allowing for flexibility in how styles are applied and overridden.
- **Responsive Design:** CSS supports media queries, enabling developers to create responsive designs that adapt to different screen sizes and devices.

### Layout Techniques:

- **Flexbox:** A layout model that allows for flexible arrangements of elements in a one-dimensional space (either row or column).
- **Grid:** A two-dimensional layout system that enables the creation of complex grid-based designs.

### CSS Frameworks:

Popular frameworks like Bootstrap and Tailwind CSS provide pre-defined styles and components, accelerating the development process and ensuring consistency across web projects.
